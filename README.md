## Overview

## Features

- **Dynamic Section Management:** Add, edit, and delete sections, including user-created sections.
- **Subsection Handling:** User-created sections always use the "Subsection" template, preventing conflicts.
- **Export to PDF:** Users can download their resume as a high-quality PDF.

- **Live Preview:** Real-time preview of the resume while editing.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (for UI components and state management)
- **TypeScript** (for type safety)
- **Vite** (for fast development and build tooling)
- **HTML/CSS** (for styling and layout)
- **html2canvas & jsPDF** (for PDF generation)

## Future Improvements

- **Subsection deletion:** Delete specific subsections rather than whole sections.
- **Drag & Drop Sections:** Allow users to reorder sections easily.
- **Auto-Save:** Save progress locally to prevent data loss.
